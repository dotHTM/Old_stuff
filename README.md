## Graphing Calculator

A collection of work on a 3 axis gimble plot. The mostly final piece is the file `Funtionalized_three_ring.gcf`

All* files are visible in the excellent [Pacific Tech](https://www.pacifict.com) app Graphing Calulator and it's [free viewer app](https://www.pacifict.com/FreeStuff.html). By the way, If you're not already familiar, checkout the [developer's story of "breaking into"](https://www.pacifict.com/Story/) the PowerPC era of the Mac.

> *Also included is a single Mac Grapher file where I was considering changing to that tool at some point.

## Quartz Composer

Files are viewable in some versions of Quicktime Player on Mac, and in Quartz Composer available from [Apple's Developer Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/) as "Additional Tools for Xcode".
